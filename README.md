# LemonadeStand

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.3.

## Things to note:
1. The API calls are simulated.
1. The login button is not expected to work so no work needs to be done on that feature.
1. Features are listed in order of priority. You do not need to implement them all but complete as many as reasonably possible.
1. Spend between 30 and 60 minhutes on the tasks below.

## Tasks
1. **Make sure the application is working correctly** (it builds and runs in the browser).
1. **Identify and resolve any issues** (i.e. does the data load correctly? do the pages all work? etc.)
1. **Add features**:
    1. Add a current page indicator so the user knows which page they are currently on.
    1. Add column sorting to the table on the sales page (each column should be able to be sorted on click of the column header and the order should reverse when clicked multiple times).
    1. Create an about us page and populate it with the company data from the API (all fields except the id should be visible on the page). Match the style of the app as much as possible while keeping the page simple.
    1. Create a component that displays the selected product(s), total price, and gives the user the ability to remove products for the current sale (i.e. a shopping cart).
1. **Provide feedback**. Would you do things differently if you were to start this project from scratch? If so, what and why? Would you use a different tech stack? If so, what and why? This feedback can be provided in person or via email to jeremy.winfree@thevillagestsg.com.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g c component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Share your work

Create a branch with your name (i.e. `john-doe`) and push your changes. A video call or in-person meeting will be scheduled to review the changes and discuss the process. A pair programming session may be scheduled as well to complete tasks in real time.
